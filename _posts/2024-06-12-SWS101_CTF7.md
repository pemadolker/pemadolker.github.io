## Overview

This penetration test aims to exploit vulnerabilities on the `creative.thm` server to obtain the `user.txt` and `root.txt` flags. The approach involves conducting an initial reconnaissance, identifying potential vulnerabilities, exploiting them to gain access, and escalating privileges to achieve our objectives.

## What I Did

### Initial Reconnaissance

1. **Nmap Scan**:
    - Conducted a comprehensive scan to discover open ports and services on the target server.
    - Discovered OpenSSH on port 22 and nginx on port 80.

2. **Subdomain Discovery**:
    - Used FFuF to find additional subdomains.
    - Discovered `beta.creative.thm`.

### Investigating the Subdomain

1. **URL Tester App**:
    - Found an app on `beta.creative.thm` that allows testing URLs, potentially vulnerable to SSRF.

### Exploiting SSRF

1. **Capture and Save the Request**:
    - Captured a POST request to `beta.creative.thm` and saved it as `request.txt`.

2. **Use SSRFmap**:
    - Cloned the SSRFmap repository and moved the request file into the directory.
    - Ran SSRFmap to enumerate open ports and found port 1337 open on `localhost`.

3. **Read Sensitive Files**:
    - Exploited the URL tester to access `id_rsa` file of user `saad`.

4. **Log in via SSH**:
    - Extracted and formatted the SSH key.
    - Attempted to log in as `saad` using the extracted key.

### Cracking SSH Key Passphrase

1. **Use John the Ripper**:
    - Cracked the `id_rsa` passphrase using John the Ripper with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

### Gaining Shell Access

1. **Log in as Saad**:
    - Successfully logged in using the cracked passphrase.

### Enumeration and Privilege Escalation

1. **Discover Credentials**:
    - Found credentials in the `.bash_history` file.

2. **Check Sudo Privileges**:
    - Enumerated sudo privileges for `saad`.

3. **LD_PRELOAD Exploit**:
    - Created an exploit using `LD_PRELOAD` to gain root privileges.
    - Compiled and executed the exploit to obtain a root shell.

### Capturing Flags

1. **User Flag**:
    - Found `user.txt` in `saad`'s home directory.

2. **Root Flag**:
    - Accessed and captured the root flag with elevated privileges.

## Summary

Through  approach of reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, and exploitation, I was able to gain unauthorized access to the `creative.thm` server. Utilizing tools like Nmap, FFuF, and SSRFmap, identified key vulnerabilities including SSRF and leveraged the LD_PRELOAD technique for privilege escalation. This allowed me to capture both the user and root flags, successfully completing the penetration test objectives.

- **User Flag**: `9a1ce90a7653d74ab98630b47b8b4a84`
- **Root Flag**: `<root_flag_value>`
