## Topic : Crack the hash

## Overview
This room-crack the hash was very easy to complete which took me around 20 mins with the help of the online tool`hashes` which cracks the hashes within few seconds. The room consists of two level, level 1 with easy to crack hash questions and level 2 with bit more difficulty.

Hash cracking is the process of recovering plaintext data from its hashed form. Hashes are used in various applications to secure sensitive information like passwords.

### Level 1

Cracking the hashes:
1. 48bb6e862e54f2a795ffc4e541caed4d 
* Hint - md5

2. CBFDAC6008F9CAB4083784CBD1874F76618D2A97
* Hint - sha..but which version

3. 1C8BFE8F801D79745C4631D09FFF36C82AA37FC4CCE4FC946683D7B336B63032
* Hint - Sha..

4. $2y$12$Dwt1BZj6pcyc3Dy1FWZ5ieeUznr71EeNkJkUlypTsgbX1H68wsRom
* Hint - Search the hashcat examples page (https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) for $2y$. This type of hash can take a very long time to crack, so either filter rockyou for four character words, or use a mask for four lower case alphabetical characters.

5. 279412f945939ba78ce0758d3fd83daa
* Hint - md4

### Level 2

Hash: 1DFECA0C002AE40B8619ECF94819CC1B
* Hint - NTLM

Hash: e5d8870e5bdd26602cab8dbe07a942c8669e56d6
* Hint - HMAC-SHA1

### Conclusion

MD5, MD4, and NTLM have played significant roles in the development of cryptographic and authentication systems. However, modern systems should rely on stronger cryptographic hash functions and authentication protocols to ensure security.
