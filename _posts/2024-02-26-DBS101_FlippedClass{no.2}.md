### Topic: Entity Relationship Diagram

The flipped class was conducted on the topic Entity Relationship Diagram where 6 groups of 4 students each were formed. Each group was assigned to a unique/proposed topic for which they were supposed to draw an Entity Relationship Diagram. We were given 10 mins to form the group that was already assigned , 50 mins to discuss within and draw a suitable ERD for the topic on a chart paper and 10 mins each group to present to the class. We were expected to map the cardinalities, show what type of relationship participation it takes, differentiate strong and weak entities,specify primary key, show contraints and know how to decide between Entities and Attributes as we already learned.


- What I have learned in this flipped class.
Each group were given a topic to draw and explain their ERD to the class and here's who one of the group explained.
As for group 1, their topic was online health book(E-health)- Patient Health Records. They identified patient(patientId as primary key), doctor(doctorId as its primary key), appointment(appointmentId as its primary key), medical record(recordId as its primary key), and medication(medicationId as its primary key) as their entities. Their first entity patient- stored the informations of the patient, doctor entity stored the information of the doctor such as name and what they are specialized in, appointment entity stored schedule of the appoinments with the doctors, medication entity stored information of medication and lastly the medical record kept records of what disease the patient was diagnosed with and what were the medicines prescribed. They also explained how patient to appointment had Many-to-Many relationship, doctor to appointment had One-to-Many relationship, patient to Medical Record had One-to-Many relationship, doctor to medical record had One-to-Many relationship and how appointment to medical record had One-to-One relationship. They kept patient, doctor and medication as strong entities and record and appointment as weak entities as they depend on parent entities.

This activity after learning ERD really helped me understand ERD in depth and made it interesting. I would rate 4.5 for this flipped class on scale 1-5 and I think that flipped class is improving.
