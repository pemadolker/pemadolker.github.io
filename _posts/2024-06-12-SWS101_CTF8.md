## Overview

The goal is to retrieve two flags by effectively leveraging Hydra's capabilities to automate the password-guessing process.

### Hydra Overview

Hydra is a versatile and efficient network login cracker. It can perform brute-force attacks against a variety of protocols, such as SSH, FTP, HTTP(S) forms, and more. Hydra automates the process of attempting multiple username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access to systems.

### Brute-Forcing Web Form Password

When brute-forcing a web form password, Hydra is configured to send numerous POST requests with different credentials until the correct combination is identified. Key components of the command include:
- The target URL of the login form.
- Parameters for the username and password fields.
- A string indicating a failed login attempt.

### Brute-Forcing SSH Password

For SSH brute-forcing, Hydra attempts different username and password combinations over the SSH protocol. Important command elements include:
- The target IP address.
- The username to be tested.
- A wordlist containing potential passwords.
- The number of parallel threads to speed up the process.

### Practical Application

The exercise involved brute-forcing passwords for a user named Molly. Based on the provided hints, I used Hydra to crack both the web form password and the SSH password. The commands were tailored to target the specific login mechanisms, utilizing the popular `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

## Steps and Execution

### Step 1: Brute-Force Web Form Password

1. **Identify Target**: The web login page is located at `/login` on the target IP address.
2. **Command Construction**:
    ```bash
    hydra -l molly -P rockyou.txt 10.10.123.73 http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V
    ```
3. **Run Hydra**: Execute the command and monitor the output for successful login credentials.
4. **Retrieve Flag 1**: Log in to the web application using the discovered password and capture the flag.

### Step 2: Brute-Force SSH Password

1. **Re-use Username**: The username `molly` is assumed to be the same for SSH.
2. **Command Construction**:
    ```bash
    hydra -l molly -P rockyou.txt 10.10.123.73 -t 4 ssh -V
    ```
3. **Run Hydra**: Execute the command and observe the output for successful SSH login credentials.
4. **Retrieve Flag 2**: SSH into the target machine using the discovered password and capture the flag.

## Summary

Through the use of Hydra, I successfully brute-forced Molly's web and SSH passwords, demonstrating the tool's efficiency in automated password cracking. This exercise emphasized the importance of strong, unique passwords to protect against such attacks.
