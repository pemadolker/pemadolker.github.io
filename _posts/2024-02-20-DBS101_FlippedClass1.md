### Topic : Database User and Database Administrators


Today's flipped class was conducted on database user and database administrators where we were divided into four groups of 6 members.
Two groups were assigned to learn more specifically on types of database users and other two to learn specifally on role of database administrators. We were given 5 minutes to get into groups, 20 minutes for group discussions, 20 minutes to present it to home group and 15 minutes for question and answer session. Day before flipped class our module tutor already introduced us to database system which made flipped class topics of flipped class more understandable.

What I have learned from today's flipped class.
I have learnt about the different types of database users and their roles, and the importance of the functions performed by database administrators. My group got to do the types of user topic so here's how I explained to my homegroup; there are seven types of database users in database management system which are categorized based up on their interaction with the database.

Types of database users are : 
1. Naive / Parametric End Users are those users who use database applications to get their desired results in day to day life without really having any DBMS knowledge.Ex. users who use the online ticketing system to book train tickets without understanding that DBMS supports the systems.
2. System Analyst are the users who analyzes the needs of parametric end users and the development team and they check if they meet users' expectations.
3. Sophisticated Users are users with a high level of expertise like engineers and scientists who knows well about database. They dont write the program code but they can create their own applications.
4. Database Designers are users who do the designing like the structure of database . They controls what data can be stored .
5. Application Programmers are those software engineers who writes the code for the application programs.
6. Casual Users/ Temporary Users are users whoo occasionally access the database  and each time tehy access they will need new information.
7. Specialized users are sophisticated users that go beyond traaditional data processing and who writes specialized database application .

Then other two groups talked on roles of Database administrator. ie Database design and Database Security. Database design involves administrator talking to people to understand what a datbase should be doing , how it is connected and preparing from emergencies by having backups and Database security is when Database administrator act as an security gaurd of the database, they decide who can go ,keep things private and update the security regularly .

I would rate 4 for our first flipped class on scale 1-5 and I personally really think that flipped class is a good learning practice .
