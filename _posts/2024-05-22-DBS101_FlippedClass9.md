### Topic: Query Optimization

### Expected Outcomes
1. Explain query optimization through materialised views.
2. Understand advanced topics in query optimisation

### Let's get started
The flipped class was conducted on `Query optimization `. 4 groups of 6 students were formed for the travia groups. The students in their trivia group will create trivia questions on the 2 topics given to them for the other group. Group 1 and group 3 were to discuss on materialised views and group 2 and 4 on advanced topics in Query Optimization.
We were given 10 minutes for the group discussion and 10 minutes for discussing in the trivia groups and lastly 30 minutes for the trivia round.

## Materialized view
Query optimization through materialized views is a technique used in database management to improve query performance. Materialized views store the result of a query physically, unlike regular views, which are virtual tables that are generated dynamically when accessed. By storing the results of complex queries, materialized views can significantly reduce the time required to execute subsequent queries that can benefit from these precomputed results.

### Benefits of Using Materialized Views
**Performance Improvement**: Since the results are precomputed and stored, querying a materialized view can be significantly faster than running the original query, especially if it involves complex joins and aggregations.
**Reduced Load**: Materialized views can offload the computational burden from the database server because the complex queries are run less frequently.

### Refreshing Materialized Views
**Refresh Strategies**: Materialized views need to be kept up-to-date to reflect changes in the underlying data. There are several strategies for refreshing materialized views:
**Complete Refresh**: The materialized view is entirely recomputed from the base tables.
**Incremental (Fast) Refresh**: Only the changes since the last refresh are applied to the materialized view.
**On-Demand Refresh**: The materialized view is refreshed manually by the user.
**Scheduled Refresh**: The materialized view is refreshed at regular intervals automatically.

## Advanced Topics in Query Optimization
### 1. Cost-Based Optimization (CBO)

- **Overview**: Cost-based optimization involves estimating the costs (in terms of CPU, I/O, memory, and other resources) for various query execution plans and choosing the plan with the lowest estimated cost.
- **Statistics Collection**: Accurate statistics about the data distribution, table sizes, and index cardinalities are crucial for effective cost estimation.
- **Histograms and Sampling**: Using histograms and sampling methods to better understand data distribution and improve the accuracy of cost estimates.

### 2. Query Rewriting

- **Semantic Query Optimization**: Transforming the query into an equivalent form that can be executed more efficiently. This includes simplifying expressions, removing redundant joins, and merging subqueries.
- **Materialized View Matching**: Automatically rewriting queries to use existing materialized views when possible, thereby reducing computation time.

### 3. Indexing Strategies

- **Advanced Index Types**: Using various types of indexes such as B-trees, hash indexes, bitmap indexes, and spatial indexes to optimize query performance.
- **Index Selection and Tuning**: Choosing the right indexes based on query patterns and workload, and tuning them to balance read and write performance.

### 4. Partitioning

- **Horizontal Partitioning**: Splitting a table into multiple smaller tables (partitions) based on a key value, improving query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.
- **Vertical Partitioning**: Splitting a table by columns, storing frequently accessed columns separately from less frequently accessed ones.
- **Composite Partitioning**: Combining multiple partitioning methods, such as range-hash partitioning, for more effective data management.

### 5. Parallel Query Execution

- **Intra-Query Parallelism**: Breaking down a single query into smaller tasks that can be executed in parallel across multiple processors or nodes.
- **Intra-Operator and Inter-Operator Parallelism**: Parallelizing individual operators (e.g., parallel scans or joins) or multiple operators within a query plan.

### 6. Adaptive Query Processing

- **Dynamic Re-Optimization**: Adjusting the query execution plan on the fly based on intermediate results and runtime statistics.
- **Learning-Based Optimization**: Using machine learning techniques to predict the optimal query execution plan based on historical data and patterns.

### 7. Advanced Join Techniques

- **Hash Joins**: Using hash tables to speed up join operations, especially useful for equi-joins.
- **Merge Joins**: Efficient for sorted data or data that can be sorted on-the-fly, minimizing the need for complex lookups.
- **Nested Loop Joins**: Used when one table is small, and the other is large, iterating through the smaller table and searching for matching rows in the larger one.
- **Star Joins**: Optimized for star schema data warehouses, allowing efficient joins between fact and dimension tables.

### 8. Query Plan Caching and Reuse

- **Plan Caching**: Storing the execution plans of frequently run queries to avoid re-planning.
- **Parameterized Queries**: Using placeholders for variable parts of queries to increase the cache hit rate.

### 9. Data Skew Handling

- **Skew-Aware Optimization**: Adjusting the query plans to handle data skew, where certain values occur much more frequently than others, which can lead to performance bottlenecks.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing the workload evenly across processing units to mitigate the effects of data skew.

### 10. Distributed Query Optimization

- **Data Locality Awareness**: Ensuring that data is processed close to where it is stored to minimize data movement across the network.
- **Federated Query Optimization**: Optimizing queries that span multiple heterogeneous data sources, each potentially with its own optimization mechanisms.
- **Global Query Plans**: Creating execution plans that consider the distributed nature of the data and the underlying network topology.

### 11. Approximate Query Processing

- **Sampling and Sketches**: Using statistical techniques to approximate query results when exact accuracy is not required, significantly reducing query time.
- **Probabilistic Data Structures**: Employing structures like Bloom filters or HyperLogLog to estimate results efficiently.

### 12. Temporal and Spatial Query Optimization

- **Time-Series Optimization**: Optimizing queries on time-series data, considering the temporal nature of the data.
- **Spatial Indexing**: Using R-trees, quad-trees, and other spatial indexing techniques to optimize queries involving geographic data.

### 13. Query Optimization in NoSQL Databases

- **Schema Design**: Crafting schemas in document-oriented, column-family, key-value, and graph databases to optimize query performance.
- **Consistency and Concurrency**: Balancing consistency and concurrency requirements with performance in distributed NoSQL environments.


### Conclusion

Query optimization through materialized views involves precomputing and storing the results of complex queries to improve performance and reduce the computational load on the database server. By using materialized views, queries that would otherwise take a long time to execute can be sped up significantly, making them an effective tool in the optimization toolbox, particularly in data-intensive applications like data warehousing. Proper management, including regular refreshing and balancing storage and maintenance costs, is essential for maximizing the benefits of materialized views.
Advanced query optimization encompasses a variety of strategies tailored to different database architectures and use cases. These techniques include sophisticated indexing and partitioning methods, dynamic and adaptive optimization strategies, and leveraging both traditional algorithms and modern machine learning approaches. The goal is to enhance query performance, ensure efficient resource usage, and provide faster response times in diverse and complex database environments. 

Understanding and applying these advanced optimization techniques is crucial for database administrators and developers to achieve optimal query performance and resource utilization.
